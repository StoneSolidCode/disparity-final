Created by Stone Kaech

This map shows the disparity between the % population of African Americans and the percentage of police killings they make up.

This data has the potential to influence those who may be questioning the authenticity of the Black Lives Matter movement. It gives reason to the anger we are seeing and shows doubters that there is a cause to protest for.

Having statistics and evidence is an important part of a movement. Creating and using visualizations like these has more of a potential to make change and get a reaction from authorities who have the power to enact reform. Its a more direct way of communication.
